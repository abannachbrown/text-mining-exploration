Exploring the depression dataset using text-mining. 
The depression data is a list of all animal studies modelling depression for a systematic review and overview of the field. 
This dataset was screened using machine learning, see publication: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-0942-7 

The records in the depression dataset are annotated with key-words associated with depresion, such as commonly used methods to induce models of depression and antidepressants. Dictionaries of keywords are available here: https://github.com/camaradesuk/RegexDictionaries
